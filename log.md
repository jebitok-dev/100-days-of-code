**Today's Progress**: forked the repository and publicly committed to #100daysofcode challenge. Wasn't sure of resources to use. Tied between FreeCodeCamp, Odin Project.

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
